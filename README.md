🔐 Cryptography Encoder & Decoder
A hacker-themed web application for encoding and decoding text using multiple cryptographic techniques like Caesar Cipher, Base64, AES Encryption, MD5, and SHA-256.

📌 Project Overview
This project is a browser-based cryptography tool that allows users to encode and decode text using various cryptographic algorithms. It provides real-time encryption and decryption for some methods, while others (like MD5 & SHA-256) are one-way hashes.

✨ Features
✔ Caesar Cipher – Encrypt & Decrypt text with shift-based substitution.
✔ Base64 Encoding/Decoding – Encode binary data into ASCII format.
✔ AES Encryption – Securely encrypt and decrypt text with a passphrase.
✔ MD5 & SHA-256 Hashing – Generate irreversible hash values for security.
✔ Hacker-Themed UI – Styled for a cybersecurity-inspired experience.
✔ Fully Client-Side – No backend needed, runs entirely in the browser.

💡 How to Use?
Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

Select a cryptographic method from the dropdown menu.

Click "Encode" to encrypt the text.

Click "Decode" to decrypt (if applicable).

Note: MD5 & SHA-256 are one-way hashing algorithms and cannot be decrypted.
